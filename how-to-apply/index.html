<h4>Process of Granting Assistance:</h4>
<p>The ability of the Trust to render assistance has increased significantly since its inception.<br/>
In 1998-99, 7 students were provided financial assistance, while in 2015-16, the number was 92. <br/><br/>
The broad criteria followed for grant of scholarships are as under:<br/></p>
<ol>
<li>The parent's/guardian's annual income should not exceed Rs. 1,00,000 (in 1997 this limit was Rs. 36000). </li>
<li>Assistance is provided for higher education after successful completion of Standard 10(S.S.C).</li>
<li>Marks secured at Standard 10 level is an important factor in deciding whether or not to grant assistance. <ul>
   <li>
    In order to renew assistance each year, the student will have to secure a minimum of 60% marks.
   </li>
  <li>
Financial assistance is provided to students across various fields of education, preference being given to courses that are likely to increase the chances of securing a job soon after completion of education, or those that would enable the student to start an independent business.
  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Special circumstances like extreme poverty, special skills, disability etc. are given due consideration.</li>
</ol>
